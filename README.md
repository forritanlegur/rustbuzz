# rustbuzz
My first shot at rust!

The idea was to make a fizzbuzz inspired program, but different. This is rustbuzz! It will generate two random numbers. If the first number is even and the second one is odd then it will print "rustacean" and then you win. If you get any other combination, then you lose, I guess. 

I am aware the code architecture is really unorthodox/terrible. My approach to making this program was basically just improvising and googling all the errors that came up.
